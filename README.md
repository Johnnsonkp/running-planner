## _Identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it_

During the pandemic when gyms were shut down universally, people had to resort to other ways in order to keep fit. Running is the one full proof way to keep fit year round without paying a cent. All that is required is a good solid pair of runners and a large enough outdoor space or treadmill. 

Finding a time and a place to go for a run can be a headache, this app will take care of that. Providing a structured approach to running that encourages the user to stick to the plan in order to achieve he’s or her goal.
